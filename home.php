						<hr/>
						<p>LetÂ´s go volunteer is a group of young, enthusiastic local people who have discovered the joy of helping, giving and sharing with those in need.</p>
						<img src="img/inline/children_volunteer_group.gif" alt="Working with Children" class="right" />
						<p>Our grass-roots programs provide real opportunities to help disadvantaged children, women and the elderly living in our city and our volunteers form an important part of making that happen.</p> 
						<p>Let's Go Volunteer welcomes volunteers from every country on earth. We do not discriminate based on age, religion, sexual orientation, skin color or any other characteristic.</p>
						<p>We simply hope to have enthusiastic, loving and caring volunteers, who are flexible, tolerant and sensitive to the needs of fellow human beings.</p>
						<p>We look for volunteers who are between the ages of 16 and 80, who would want to help while experiencing a new culture and enjoy themselves.</p>
