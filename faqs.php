							<li>How long can I volunteer?
								<p>The term of your stay will be defined in accordance with your own individual needs and interests. However, we have standard programs ranging from 1 week up to 9 months. Should you wish to stay longer, you can arrange for it at a later date, provided that your apply for an extension on your stay in the country.</p>
							    <p>We would be happy to have you here for as long as you want.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Is there any financial support or tax deduction?
								<p>Unfortunately we are a small organization that has not the possibility of helping out with the fees. Our expenses are based on the needs of the programs and of the low administrational costs. Related to the tax deductions we are a Colombian registered non-governmental organization, so you will need to find out in your own country if you could get tax deduction.</p>
							</li>
							<li>When is the best time to come?
								<p>Every time of the year is a good time to come. We have a calendar that can suit the needs of any of our individual volunteers - we want you to come when you can, so that you have the option of materializing your dream of volunteering at any time of the year.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Can people from all nationalities apply?
								<p>Sure they can, we welcome people from every country on earth, and we do not discriminate based on age, religion, sexual orientation, skin color or any other characteristic.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Where will I be working?
								<p>You will be working at any of the described programs, depending upon your interests. All programs take place in Ibagué, Colombia.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Do I need to have experience?
								<p>Not at all, the only thing you need is enthusiasm, tolerance, social awareness, and the desire to help others in need.</p>
							</li>
							<li>What happens if I need any special diet?
								<p>Let us know if you have any special requests, we will make sure you have a comfortable stay, and we will do the best we can to suit your needs and take care of you.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Is there a way I can see what it will be like and maybe talk to some of the volunteers?

There you will find photos and videos from all the aspects of volunteering with us. You will also be able to get in touch with the staff, current and former volunteers.</p>
							<li>How do I know you are a serious and reputable organization?
								<p>We are a registered NGO and we currently have agreements with the local government. We administer and execute public funds. We are very much admired by the community. Our Board of Directors is composed of local business people including the Regional Manager of the biggest insurance company in the country, and a successful and respected entrepreneur, all of whom are volunteers and do not receive any money or compensation at all. Trust us; we are very frugal and honest.</p>
							</li>
							<li>What can I expect?
								<p>Prepare your self for an experience that might change your life, the way you view it and even your career. Enjoy every moment. Relax and don't take life too seriously. Also, try to be tolerant; as Colombians might not be the most punctual people on earth and there is a different conception of time and rhythms.</p>
								<p>People in Colombia might often be very curious about your life back home and overwhelm you with questions. Colombians are particularly fond of getting to know, talk and make friends with foreigners - we like to show the best of our country and our culture to anyone who wants to learn more about it and share a nice time with us. Last but not least: Do come! YOU WILL HAVE A GREAT TIME.</p>

							</li>
							<li>Can I go with friends, colleges or family?
